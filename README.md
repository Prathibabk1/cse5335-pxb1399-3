# Implementation Easy
I found the implementation of server easy as I had exposure to mongoDB in project2 and sending the content from server to client had been known form project1.

# Implementation Difficult
 I found the implementation of client side difficult as we had to figure out a way to generate the key to make ajax calls every 0.5s interval and the local storage made it easier to overcome this difficulty.

# Concern on using nodejs professionally
- Event driven model will confuse a lot of programmers who are new to JavaScript.
- The callback chain can get very long which makes it harder to maintain. A long chain of callbacks to get the data asynchronously.
-  Node API is changing very rapidly which might cause incompatibility and bugs when you upgrade.  
-  Another difficult is to getting used to asynchronus programming model
